                        In this first graph  it is possible to visualize the entire maps of the world divided per country.<br>
                        In this  choropleth map we want to display the worldwide situation of life expectancy value in all the developed countries during the year 2015.<br>
                        Thanks to a green color map (light green to dark green) we can understand in which country we have the highest value of life expectancy, the lightes color of green is used for labeled the "Developing" countries.<br> 
                        Trough the tooltip we can clearly visualize all the life expectancy countries situations.<br>
                        We can see that the greatest amount of developed countries are centered in Europe , no country in Africa is considered "Developed".<br>

                    <p>
                        In the next part of the analysis of the "Developed"countries  , we want to see which country has the greatest value of life expectancy.<br>
                        We will do this using a barplot that it  is used to display the relationship between a numerical(Life expectancy) and a categorical variable (Developed Country).<br>
                        We can , easily , see that the best country for life expectancy is Slovenia and the worst is Lithuania considering the year 2015.<br>
                        With the tooltip you can visualize the exact value of life expectancy per country.

                <h3>Scatter plot of Population and Life Expectancy</h3>
                 
                    <p>
                        In this third plot of the analysis of the "Developed" countries ,  we want to show the relationship between the population and the life expectancy of each "Developed" country. <br>
                        In the x axis there is the Life Expectancy , whereas in the y axis the Population. Every single dot represents a country and every country has a different color from the other, tooltip with all the information is provided <br>
                        It could be interesting analzying a little bit this situation. <br>
                        Countries where the life expectancy is higher look like to have a lower quantity of inhabitants ( for example the first is Slovenia , then Denmark and Cyprus).<br>
                        Countries with a higher amount of Population are in the middle of the graphs and they have similar values for life expectancy. <br>
                        It is also interesting to notice that most of the best countries are islands such : Japan , Singapore , Cyprus , Iceland , Australia. <br> 
                        On the other hand , the lowest life expectancy is centered in East Europe with countries such as : Lithuania , Bulgaria , Latvia , Hungary and Romania <br>

                <h3>Timeline from 2000 to 2015 </h3>
                 
                    <p>
                        In the last part of this analysis , we would like to check the trend of life expectancy during the years starting from 2000 to 2015. <br>
                        With this kind of visualization , we have the possibility to analyze precisely the trend of each country thanks to the dropdown menu and thanks to the tooltip that will display the life expectancy at the selected year. <br>
                        It could be useful analyze two different kinds of trend.<br>
                        The first to see is Cyprus. This island it started with a value of life expectancy of 78.1 years old and year after year this value has been increased drastically reaching the value of 85 years old of life expectancy. It could be a good place to move if you get rid of your country. <br>
                        The second trend interesting to go into detail is Latvia. It started with 71 then goes down to 69.9 then for some years the life expectancy goes up and down . After 2008 , it started to have a more linear life expectancy growth.

                   Select the "Developed" country you want to visualize in the timeline: 
                   
                   <select id="selectButton"class="selectionBox"></select>
