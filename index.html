                The term “life expectancy” refers to the number of years a person can expect to live. 
                By definition, life expectancy is based on an estimate of the average age that members of a particular population group will be when they die.
                An important point to bear in mind when interpreting life expectancy estimates is that very few people will die at precisely the age indicated by life expectancy, even if mortality patterns stay constant. <br> 
                How is life expectancy calculated? <br>
                Age-specific mortality rates are usually estimated by counting (or projecting) the number of age-specific deaths in a time interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 who died in the year 2005), and dividing by the total observed 
                (or projected) population alive at a given point within that interval (e.g. the number of people aged 10-15 alive on 1 July 2015).

                To ensure that the resulting estimates of the probabilities of death within each age interval are smooth across the lifetime, it is common to use mathematical formulas, to model how the force of mortality changes within and across age intervals.
                Once we have estimates of the fraction of people dying across age intervals, it is simple to calculate a ‘life table’ showing the evolving probabilities of survival and the corresponding life expectancies by age. 
                The dataset considered was taken from Kaggle.com  at this link <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who"> Life Expectancy(WHO)</a> , which gives to us a statistical analysis  of factors influencing life expectancy.
                What we would like to analyze in this project  are the differences and similiraties between developed countries and developing countries.<br>
               A <b> Developed Country </b> :  is a sovereign state that has a high quality of life, developed economy and advanced technological infrastructure <br> relative to other less industrialized nations. 
               Developed countries have generally more advanced post-industrial economies,  meaning the service sector provides more wealth than the industrial sector <br>
               A <b> Developing Country</b> :  is a sovereign state with a lesser developed industrial base and a lower Human Development Index (HDI)<br> relative to other countries.  Developing countries tend to have some characteristics in common often due to their histories or geographies. 
               <br>For example, they commonly have: lower levels of access to safe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene, energy poverty,<br> higher levels of pollution 
               (e.g. air pollution, littering, water pollution, open defecation), higher proportions of people with tropical and infectious diseases (neglected tropical diseases), more road traffic accidents, and generally poorer quality infrastructure.

                In this first block of visual representations, we want to analyze the entire world divide per country and extract life <br>

                The we want to analyze the percentage of immunization for 3 different diseases in the most populated developing countries <br>
                The next graph it will help us to notice the diseases distribution in each country.<br>
                In the final part , we want to visualize the trend of the life expectancy starting from year 2000 to 2015.<br>

            The first map is equal to the previous one , because we want to visualize the worldwide situation. <br>

            This part continues analyzing the relationship between the population of a country and its life expectancy. <br>
            In the last part , it is possible to understand the time situation of each desired country. <br>
