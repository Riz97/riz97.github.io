                        It is possible to visualize the entire maps of Trento city divided per neighborhoods. The total number of neighborhoods is 11. In this first choropleth map we want to display
                        the tree abundance of each neighborhood . Thanks to a green color map (light green to dark green) we can understand in which neighborhood we have the majority of trees. 
                        In the tooltip , there's also the area of each neighborhood. For example , the greatest amount of trees is in the neighborhood called "S.Giuseppe-S.Chiara"

                        Considering the same measurements saw before, now we visualize the boxplots of the top 5 tree species.
                        Thanks to boxplots, we can display some descriptive statistical informations like the median, the maximimum,
                        the minimum, and the quartiles of each distribution. Potentials outliers are plotted as individual points.
                        For example, looking at the height, we can instantly see that <span class="font-italic">Platanus x hispanica</span>
                        species is usually higher with respect to the other species, and more spread, lookind at the IQR.
                        <br>It is possible to visualize the Q1, Q3, mean, and median values of each box overing it with the mouse.

                    <p>
                        For the top 6 most populated tree species, we display a scatterplot having on the x axis the size of trees, like
                        the height, diameter, canopy size, and leaf area, and and on the y axis the kilograms of CO&#8322; absorbed in a year.
                        We want to discover possible correlations between these variables.
                        <br>Moving the mouse over the single data-point, we can visualize the exact value of the selected measure and the amount of CO&#8322;
                        absorbed by the tree, highlighting all the trees of this species.

                            In this plot we want to show the trees' oxygen production for each neighborhood. But in this case we are using a different kind of color map that goes starting from 0 to max of total
                            oxygen production values (white to dark blue). This plot is correlated to the others because neighborhoods with a high number of trees have a high value of oxygen production.
                            But in this case the greatest producer of oxygen is "Centro storico piedicastello", even though it has a lower tree abundance than "S.Giuseeppe -S.Chiara". This happens probably becuase in the first
                            neighborhood there are more tree suitable for the oxygen production..
