                    with the 10 most populous countries selected for each category (developed and developing). <br>
                    It is evident from the chart that developed countries have consistently enjoyed higher life expectancies
                     than developing countries. It is noteworthy that the trend 
                    of life expectancy is on the rise for both developed and developing countries over time.<br>
                    The average life expectancy for each category is shown with a different color.<br>
                    With the tooltip we can read the name of the country, highlighting the corrisponding line.

                <h3>Boxplot comparison </h3>
                <p style = "max-width: 75ch";>  Following our analysis of the life expectancy disparity between developed and developing
                     countries, we examined other variables using boxplots to display descriptive statistical
                      information such as the median, maximum, minimum, and quartiles of each distribution. 
                      Outliers are plotted as individual points.<br>
                    Upon examining the adult mortality rates, we observed that the distribution is higher 
                    in developing countries. In contrast, the distributions of BMI (Body Mass Index), schooling,
                     and the income composition of resources (Human Development Index) are higher in developed 
                     countries.<br> However, some outliers on the x-axis are produced by missing data.

                <p style = "max-width: 75ch";>
                
                    Our analysis focuses on the life expectancy in the year 2015, with the 10 most populous 
                    countries selected for each category (developed and developing). With the exception of 
                    Romania, all developed countries have life expectancies higher than the global average. <br>
                    Interestingly, we also observed that there are some developing countries with life 
                    expectancies above the global average. On the other hand, Nigeria has a very low life 
                    expectancy of 54.5 years, which is revealed by the tooltip.

                    Circular Packing allows to visualize a hierarchic organization. In this plot we have a one level of hierarchy <br>
                    We can use this kind of plot to visualize the distribution of the world population. <br>
                    Bigger circles for countries with a large amount of population. <br>
                    We have divided the countries in two clusters  : countries on the right are "Developed" , while on the left the "Developing".<br>
                    It is important to analyze , also , the colors of the circles. <br>
                    If a circle is red , it means that that country has a very low life expectancy , so the colors depends on that. Red for low life expectancy  , orange and yellow for higher life expectancy , and green for the highest life expectancy. In between , of course, there all the shades of these colors.
                    It could be interesting to notice that , the majority of "developed" countries have a better life expectancy than "Developing".<br>
                    But there are some exception like Chile , Israel and Canada that have an intense shade of green.
