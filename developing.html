                        It is possible to visualize the entire maps of Trento city divided per neighborhoods. The total number of neighborhoods is 11. In this first choropleth map we want to display
                        the tree abundance of each neighborhood . Thanks to a green color map (light green to dark green) we can understand in which neighborhood we have the majority of trees. 
                        In the tooltip , there's also the area of each neighborhood. For example , the greatest amount of trees is in the neighborhood called "S.Giuseppe-S.Chiara"

                        Considering the same measurements saw before, now we visualize the boxplots of the top 5 tree species.
                        Thanks to boxplots, we can display some descriptive statistical informations like the median, the maximimum,
                        the minimum, and the quartiles of each distribution. Potentials outliers are plotted as individual points.
                        For example, looking at the height, we can instantly see that <span class="font-italic">Platanus x hispanica</span>
                        species is usually higher with respect to the other species, and more spread, lookind at the IQR.
                        <br>It is possible to visualize the Q1, Q3, mean, and median values of each box overing it with the mouse.

                        For the top 6 most populated tree species, we display a scatterplot having on the x axis the size of trees, like
                        the height, diameter, canopy size, and leaf area, and and on the y axis the kilograms of CO&#8322; absorbed in a year.
                        We want to discover possible correlations between these variables.

                        <p>
                            In the last part of this analysis , we would like to check the trend of life expectancy during the years starting from 2000 to 2015. <br>
                        With this kind of visualization , we have the possibility to analyze precisely the trend of each country thanks to the dropdown menu and thanks to the tooltip that will display the life expectancy at the selected year. <br>
                        It could be useful analyze some of these countries.<br>
                        The first to see is Haiti. This island has been a quite stable trend for all the years considered but with an exception. During the 2010 , the inhabitants of Haiti have been hit by a terrible earthquake
                        , for this reason the life expectancy value has dropped drammatically in that year (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake">click here</a>, if you want more information about this event). <br>
                         Another country to analyze could be Rwanda. Rwanda is a country located in Africa and in 2000 its life expectancy was 48.3 , not a a so high value. But, in the next years , life expectancy has been increased noticeably , reaching 68.0 years old.
                         An article in the website of United Nations explain this situation and what is going on in Africa (you can find it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2010_Haiti_earthquake"> here</a>). <br>
                         
                        You can play with the data just by using the dropdown menu below.
                        </p>  
                        Select the "Developing" country you want to visualize in the timeline:
                       
                       <select id="selectButton"class="selectionBox"></select>
